## Sales Data Analysis Project (Excel & Power Query)

## 1. Data Creation
I created 3 separate datasets representing sales data for 3 consecutive years - 2022, 2023, and 2024.
All datasets belong to the same company, sharing the same group of Sales Agents; In addition, I created a separate Product Table in which the product IDs and names match those used in the yearly sales datasets.

## 2. Data Transformation (Power Query & Analysis Preparation)
The datasets were imported into Power Query, where I performed the following transformations:
-Appended Queries to combine the 2022, 2023, and 2024 tables into single dataset
-Merged Queries with the Product Table using the ID of Product as a key to enrich the dataset with product prices
-Cleaned and standardized column formats for consistency

## 3. Visualization
After the transformation, the data was loaded back into Excel for further analysis.
I then created several Pivot Tables based on the merged dataset to analyze:
-Total Sales Revenue by the Sales Agent
-Product Sales Trend by the Years
-Favorable Payment Method
-Total Amount Sold and Total Revenue by the City

These Pivot Tables were later converted into interactive charts and visual elements used to design a Sales Dashboard
